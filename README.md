# Graduate project

A web application for generating pseudo-random sequences using vector and matrix generators, studying their properties and tools for their analysis.

## Pages

- **Main page:** Contains basic information about the application, its features, frequently asked questions and answers, and instructions for using generators.
- **Linear feedback shift register (LFSR):** Contains an implementation of a linear feedback shift register and additional components for analyzing generation results.
- **Matrix shift register (MSR):** Contains an implementation of a matrix shift register and additional components for analyzing generation results.
- **Sum and product:** Contains an implementation of a generator that is based on two linear registers, which creates new sequences by performing bit operations (sum and product) on pseudo-random sequences that are generated by these vector generators.
- **Frobenius:**  Contains a generator that is based on a matrix register but uses Frobenius normal form as an initial state to generate pseudo-random sequences.
- **Comparison:**  Allows you to compare linear and matrix register on the same page with additional analysis tools.
- **Polynomials:**  Contains an interactive table, available only to authorized users, with all the polynomials used for generation, their degrees and bit form.

## Features

- **Polynomial table:** Check out the large table that gives the complete list of irreducible polynomials over the field GF(2).
- **Correlation graphs:** Explore the correlation of generated sequences using correlation graphs.
- **Data storage:** Easily store and manage your query history and sequence generation data.
- **Comparison of characteristics:** Compare the characteristics and properties of matrix and linear generators right next to each other.
- **Speed:** Thanks to many optimization solutions at different levels, freezes and lags are kept to a minimum.
- **Convenient data transfer:** By saving parameters in the query string, users can easily share their data with other users by simply sending a link.
- **A single platform:** A wide range of useful pages and tools for research and sequence generation in one platform.
- **Variety of polynomials:** A wide selection of polynomials up to the 15th degree that can be used in the generation.
- **User-friendly interface:** Convenient and attractive interface that even beginners can easily master.
